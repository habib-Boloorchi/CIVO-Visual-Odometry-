# CIVO-Visual-Odometry-
Customizable and Interpretable Visual Odometry (CIVO) is a readable code Visual Odometry that can let you have the traditional Visual Odometry with different learned model that can optimize Traditional VO with any model you want via variety of activation functions.
This is the paper about that explains the code :
